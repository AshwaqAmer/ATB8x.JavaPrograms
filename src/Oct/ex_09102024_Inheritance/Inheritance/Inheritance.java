public class Inheritance {
    /*
    Inheritance is a mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features
    (fields and methods) of another class. In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing
     ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition,
     you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.

     Types of inheritances:
     1. Single Inheritance-> It inherits the properties and behavior of a single-parent class.
     2. Multilevel Inheritance-> A class inherits from multiple base classes.
     3. Hierarchical Inheritance-> A class inherits from a derived class, forming a hierarchy of inheritance.
     4. Multiple Inheritance-> Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
     5. Hybrid Inheritance-> A combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.
