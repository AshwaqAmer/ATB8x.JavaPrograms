        /* OOPs and Features.
          Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" and "classes"
          to create modular, reusable, and organized code. In Java, OOP is a fundamental approach for
          software design that allows developers to create systems that model real-world entities.
          The core concepts of OOP in Java include classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism,
          and abstraction.

          Features of OOP in Java:
          1. Classes and Objects:
          -> A class is a blueprint for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
          -> Objects encapsulate data and methods to represent real-world entities.

          2. Encapsulation:
          -> Encapsulation involves bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data
             into a single unit (class).

          3. Inheritance:
          -> Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another, enabling code reuse.

          4. Polymorphism:
          -> Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows methods or objects to have multiple forms.
          -> Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism): Defining multiple methods with the same name but different
          parameters.
          -> Method Overriding (runtime polymorphism): A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already
           defined in its superclass.

           5. Abstraction:
          -> Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.

           6. Reusability:
           -> OOP allows for code reuse through inheritance, where common functionality is defined in a base class,
           reducing redundancy.

          7. Modularity:
          -> OOP promotes modular code, as objects represent independent components that can interact with one another, enhancing the maintainability of the system.
